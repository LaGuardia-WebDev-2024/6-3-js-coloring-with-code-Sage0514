## Directions 
### Step #1 - Draw the ground <br>
We've drawn a snowperson like you made in the first challenge, and now you're going to draw more shapes using the commands you just learned.         
<br>
In this first step, use the  `rect()`  command to draw the ground, so that the snowperson isn't just floating in air. You should add your  `rect()`  command before the  `ellipse()`  commands for the snowperson, so that the snowperson looks like he is in front of the ground.       
<br>
### Step #2 - Make him wave! <br>
Now you'll make it look like the snowperson is waving by adding arms on both sides of his body, using the  `line()`  command.        
<br>
You will need to add two  `line()`  commands, one for each arm. You should add your  `line()`  commands after the  `ellipse()`  commands for the snowperson, so that the arms look like they are in front of the snowperson. 
<br>
### Step #3 - Play! <br>
Add other elements to your snowperson scene.
